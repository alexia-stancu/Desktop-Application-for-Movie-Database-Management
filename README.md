# Desktop-Application-for-Movie-Database-Management
I developed a desktop application using JavaFX for managing a movie database, allowing users to view, add, edit, and delete films, producers, and actors. I designed a relational MySQL database, implementing one-to-many (1:N) and many-to-many (M:N) relationships between entities. I created an interactive GUI using JavaFX, FXML, and SceneBuilder, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. I integrated DBOperations.java to handle database interactions efficiently through JDBC and implemented structured CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with validation, error handling, and real-time table updates. Additionally, I styled the application using CSS, ensuring a professional and user-friendly interface.
